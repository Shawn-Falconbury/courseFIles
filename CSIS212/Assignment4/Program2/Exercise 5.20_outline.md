    1. Start by defining a class Exercise520.

    2. Inside this class, we define a static method circleArea that takes one double argument (the radius) and returns a double (the area of the circle). The method calculates the area as Ï€ * radius * radius and returns the result.

    3. In the main method, we create a Scanner instance to read the user's input.

    4. Prompt the user to input the radius of a circle.

    5. Read the radius and pass it to the circleArea method.

    6. Print the result, which is the area of the circle.
