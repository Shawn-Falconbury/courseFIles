Main components of 'isMultiple'

public static:

This indicates that the method is accessible from anywhere and does not require an instance of the class to be invoked. Instead, it can be called directly on the class itself, like so: Exercise516.isMultiple(number1, number2);.

boolean:

This is the return type of the method. It specifies that this method will return a value of type boolean, which can be either true or false.

isMultiple(int first, int second):

This is the method signature. isMultiple is the name of the method, and it takes two parameters, both of type int (integer). The parameters are named first and second.

return second % first == 0;:
  
This is the body of the method, which is executed when the method is called. It calculates the remainder of the division of second by first using the modulo operator (%). If second is a multiple of first, then second divided by first          will have no remainder, so second % first will be 0. Thus, if second is a multiple of first, this method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The purpose of this method is to check if one number (second) is a multiple of another (first). 
It's a simple and clear way to encapsulate this logic, making the code more readable and reusable.
