Exercise 5.16 JHTP: Write a method isMultiple that determines, for a pair of integers, whether
the second integer is a multiple of the first. The method will take 2 integer arguments and return
true if the second is a multiple of the first and false otherwise. [Hint: Use the remainder
operator]. Incorporate this method into an application that inputs a series of pairs of integers (1
pair at a time) and determines whether the second value in each pair is a multiple of the first.
