1. Definine a class Exercise516.

2. Inside this class, define a static method isMultiple that takes two integer arguments and returns a boolean value. 
    The method returns true if the second integer is a multiple of the first (i.e., if the remainder of the second divided by the first is zero), and false otherwise.

3. In the main method, we create a Scanner instance to read the user's input.

4. Start a loop that will continue until the user decides to exit. In each iteration of the loop:

    4.1 Prompt the user to input a pair of integers.

    4.2 We read these integers and pass them to the isMultiple method.

    4.3 Print the result.

    4.4 Ask the user whether they want to check another pair of integers. If not, break the loop and end the program.
