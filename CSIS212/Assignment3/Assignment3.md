PROGRAMMING: PRODUCT OF ODD INTEGERS AND BAR CHAR ASSIGNMENT
INSTRUCTIONS

Exercise 4.12: Write an application that calculates the product of the odd integers from 1 to 15.

Exercise 4.16 JHTP (Bar Chart Printing Program): One interesting application of computers
is to display graphs and bar charts. Write an application that reads 5 numbers between 1 and 30.
For each number that reads, your program will display the same number of adjacent asterisks.
For example, if your program reads the number 7, it will display *******. Display the bars of
asterisk after you read all 5 numbers.
